      "question": "What is the main advantage of using Lasso regression over Linear regression?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It reduces training time significantly.",
        "b": "It automatically selects important features by setting some coefficients to zero.",
        "c": "It minimizes bias in the model.",
        "d": "It increases the complexity of the model."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Regularization does not focus on reducing training time.",
        "b": "Correct! Lasso regression sets some coefficients to zero, making it useful for feature selection.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Regularization aims to reduce variance, not bias.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Regularization simplifies the model by controlling complexity."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    
    {
      "question": "How does increasing the alpha value in Ridge regression affect the model?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Increases the magnitude of coefficients.",
        "b": "Decreases the magnitude of coefficients.",
        "c": "Has no impact on the model.",
        "d": "Makes the model underfit the data."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Ridge regression discourages large coefficients.",
        "b": "Correct! Increasing alpha penalizes large coefficients, leading to smaller magnitudes.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Alpha has a direct impact on regularization strength.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Higher alpha may increase bias but does not necessarily lead to underfitting."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is true about the role of alpha in Lasso and Ridge regression?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Higher alpha values reduce overfitting by increasing regularization.",
        "b": "Lower alpha values increase model complexity.",
        "c": "Alpha values have no impact on model performance.",
        "d": "Alpha values increase bias and variance simultaneously."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Higher alpha values increase regularization, reducing overfitting.",
        "b": "Partially correct, but alpha controls regularization, not complexity directly.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Alpha significantly affects model regularization.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Alpha balances bias and variance, not increases both."
