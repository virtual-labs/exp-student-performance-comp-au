The aim of this experiment is to compare the performance of **Linear Regression**, **Lasso Regression**, and **Ridge Regression** to determine the most effective approach for predictive accuracy. The experiment evaluates each model using key error metrics and examines how **L1** (Lasso) and **L2** (Ridge) regularization influence accuracy, model stability, and coefficient behavior to identify the most reliable predictive approach.
