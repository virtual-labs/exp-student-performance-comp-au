      "question": "What is the primary aim of using Lasso and Ridge regression in the experiment?",

        "a": "To improve prediction accuracy and model interpretability",
        "b": "To increase the complexity of the model",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Lasso and Ridge regression aim to improve prediction accuracy and simplify the model by regularizing coefficients.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Regularization reduces complexity, not increases it.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Lasso performs feature selection but does not eliminate its need.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Regularization may not necessarily reduce training time."

        "a": "Ridge Regression",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Ridge shrinks coefficients but does not set them to zero.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Linear regression does not involve regularization.",
        "c": "Correct! Lasso regression uses L1 regularization, which can set some coefficients to zero.",

        "a": "Partially correct, but RMSE is not the only metric used.",
        "b": "Partially correct, but R² is one of the metrics among others.",
        "c": "Partially correct, but MSE alone does not provide a complete evaluation.",
